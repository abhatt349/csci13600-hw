1) Parse the input, making it all CAPITAL
2) Loop through the data file line by line
3) For each line, split it on spaces
4) Check if the beforestring matches the input
	a) If it does, print the afterstring (pronunciation)
	b) Store the afterstring (we'll call it PRONOUNCE)
	c) Loop through the file, splitting each line on spaces
	d) Check to see if the afterstring matches PRONOUNCE
		- If it does, print the beforestring after "Identical"
5) If you reach the end of the file and there’s been no matches, print “Not found”
